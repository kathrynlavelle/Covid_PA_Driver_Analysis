## Data Source Description
The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) maintains comprehensive crash data covering all reportable traffic incidents throughout the state. The dataset includes detailed information about crash circumstances, vehicle types, driver characteristics, environmental conditions, and outcomes. Data covers crashes from 2005-2024 with approximately 110,000-135,000 crashes reported annually.

## Provenance
The Public Crash Data files consist of data obtained from Police Crash Report data submitted to PennDOT by investigating police agencies, driver reported data from the AA600 Driver's Accident Report form, and calculated fields kept in the Crash Data Analysis and Retrieval Tool (CDART) database. Data that is protected due to containing Personally Identifiable Information, or that could be used to infer information about persons involved in a crash are not included in the public dataset


## Data Source & Data Download
The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) shares the crash data with the public through the PennDOT Crash Information Tool (PCIT). The PCIT is a web-based tool that provides access to crash information and tools for analyzing crash data.

## Data Dictionary
The Pennsylvania crash dataset contains a wealth of information about crash circumstances, vehicle information, driver characteristics, and outcomes. While the dataset is comprehensive, understanding the specific field definitions, coding schemes, and data collection methodology requires careful review of the official documentation. For detailed information about data fields, variable definitions, coding standards, and collection procedures, please consult the Crash Data Primer and the official PennDOT Data Dictionary linked below, which provide essential context for proper interpretation and analysis of the crash data.

## Ethical Considerations
While crash data is anonymized, geographic analysis could potentially stigmatize certain communities or neighborhoods. Care must be taken to avoid reinforcing stereotypes about driving behavior based on demographic characteristics or geographic location. The analysis should focus on behavioral patterns rather than individual blame, and any conclusions should acknowledge the complex socioeconomic factors that influence traffic safety. Findings should be presented in a way that promotes public safety rather than sensationalizing dangerous driving behaviors.
